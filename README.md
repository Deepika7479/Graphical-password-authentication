# Graphical-password-authentication
A graphical password or graphical user authentication is a form of authentication using images rather than letters, digits, or special characters.
The type of images used and the ways in which users interact with them vary between implementations.
A graphical password is an authentication system that works by having the user select from images, in a specific order ,presented in a graphical user interface (GUI).
For this reason, the graphical-password approach is sometimes called graphical user authentication (GUA).
